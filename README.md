## Discription
This mini project is the final assignment for Quantitative Methods in Finance (FRE-GY 6083). Originally, the project aims to evaluate Disney (DIS) options for the coming week using both the Binomial Tree Model and the Black-Scholes-Merton Model. I have extended the project's scope to allow application to any stock and maturity date, as outlined in the following sections.
- Obtain historical stock price data and calculate the stock's historical volatility.
- Implement the Binomial option pricing model to value European and American options for the selected stock.
- Apply the Black-Scholes-Merton model to price options and evaluate the convergence of the Binomial model results.
- Develop a GARCH(1,1) model to forecast future volatility.
- Use the forecasted volatility in the Black-Scholes model to price options and compare these values with market prices.
